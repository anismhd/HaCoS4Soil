# Development of Hazard Consistent Spectra for Soil Sites

Various approached available in literature

	1 - Approached Based on Hazard Integral Equations
	2 - Approaches Based on UHS Scaling

Let

	$A_s$ - be out-crop ground motion amplitude at free-field

	$A_r$ - be out-crop ground motion amplitude at baserock
